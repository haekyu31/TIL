## Algorithm
1. Recursive 
```
In computer science, recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.```
```

```
b4           = 4 × b3
             = 4 × (3 × b2)
             = 4 × (3 × (2 × b1))
             = 4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × b0)))
             = 4 × (3 × (2 × (1 × 1)))
             = 4 × (3 × (2 × 1))
             = 4 × (3 × 2)
             = 4 × 6
             = 24
```
```python
# Recursive로 팩토리얼 구현
def factorial(x):
    if x == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return (x * factorial(x-1))


num = 3
print("The factorial of", num, "is", factorial(num))
# output 
# The factorial of 3 is 6

2. DFS
```
Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Extra memory, usually a stack, is needed to keep track of the nodes discovered so far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph.
```

- A preordering is a list of the vertices in the order that they were first visited by the depth-first search algorithm. This is a compact and natural way of describing the progress of the search, as was done earlier in this article. A preordering of an expression tree is the expression in Polish notation.
- A postordering is a list of the vertices in the order that they were last visited by the algorithm. A postordering of an expression tree is the expression in reverse Polish notation.
- A reverse preordering is the reverse of a preordering, i.e. a list of the vertices in the opposite order of their first visit. Reverse preordering is not the same as postordering.
- A reverse postordering is the reverse of a postordering, i.e. a list of the vertices in the opposite order of their last visit. Reverse postordering is not the same as preordering.
